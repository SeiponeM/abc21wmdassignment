<ol>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Danny is one of the OFWs who lost their job because of the crisis.
Upon returning home, Danny escapes the quarantine facility to reunite with his family only to be welcomed by the dire condition of his invalid father,
Gener. Looking for a decent job, Danny seeks the help of his former gay benefactor, Lito, in order to finance Gener's medication.
Instead, Lito endorses Danny to his friend Rene, who runs an online sex den masquerading as a legitimate coffee shop. 
This opens Danny to the world of cybersex.
