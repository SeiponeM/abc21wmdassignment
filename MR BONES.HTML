<ol>The storyline of ‘Mr. Bones 3, Son of Bones’ begins at the turn of the 20th Century
when we witness (flashback) the burying of the Kruger millions by two Boer soldiers, who then kill each other through idiotic greed,
leaving the Kruger millions hidden in a graveyard in Kuvukiland.
<ol>Now, in the present, a scrawny businessman named Alvin (Moonsammy) and his Texan engineer partner named Jack (Janks), together with their beautiful guide,
Gabrielle (Anstey) are plotting to mine for oil in the pristine land which would leave it an oily mess.
<ol>Bones and Mathambo must devise a way to outsmart the opinionated Westerners. 
Of course, as their plan unfolds, so do many other unexpected twists and turns, with hilarious effect.
